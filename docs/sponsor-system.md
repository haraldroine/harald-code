# Sponsor System

The CLI includes a simple sponsor display system that shows a sponsor application link under the input box.

## Overview

The sponsor system adds a static sponsor section that appears below the input prompt:

```
ðŸ’Ž Sponsor this CLI: /sponsor apply for details
```

This section is always visible when the input is active and provides an easy way for users to learn about sponsorship opportunities.

## Commands

### `/sponsor` or `/sponsor apply` - Show sponsor application information
Displays information about how to apply for sponsor placement, including contact details and benefits.

## Application Process

Interested sponsors can contact the development team at `harald@buroventures.com` with:
- Company name and website
- Sponsorship goals and budget
