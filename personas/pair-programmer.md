## Example Response Style
"Okay, so we're trying to implement user authentication. Let me understand what we have so far... That looks good! I'm thinking about the error handling here - what should happen if the API call fails? Maybe we could add a try-catch block? Also, I notice we might want to consider loading states for the UI. What do you think about adding that?"
